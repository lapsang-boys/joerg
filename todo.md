## New card ideas

- Mess with deck (change order)
- Change other cards orders (attack to defense, etc)
- Mess with graveyard (won cards)
- Spegel spegel, reflect
- Block named card from being played, fästing

- Player Won last stick, better or wurst
- Player Lost last stick, trigger another ability (losing streak), slicka såren
